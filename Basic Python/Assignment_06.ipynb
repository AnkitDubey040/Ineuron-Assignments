    "#### 1. What are escape characters, and how do you use them?\n",
    "##### Ans:  \n",

    "#### 4. The string \"Howl's Moving Castle\" is a correct value. Why isn't the single quote character in the word Howl's not escaped a problem?  \n",
    "##### Ans:   \n",
    "The string \"Howl's Moving Castle\" escaped the problem because it is wrapped inside double quotes and inside double quotes we can have a single quote , it will not create any syntax error, however if it was wrapped inside single quotes then we have to use escape character \\' to show single quote in the final output.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. How do you write a string of newlines if you don't want to use the n character?  \n",
